                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p>
                    The ACP Controle Time Brevets project is a web application designed to simplify the process of creating and managing brevets in bike races according to Audax Club Parisien (ACP) regulations. This application automates the calculation of control times for various checkpoints in long-distance cycling events, ensuring compliance with ACP standards. It provides an intuitive interface for organizers to input race details and generates accurate time windows for each control point.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from the complex nature of organizing long-distance cycling events and the need for accurate time management. As a cycling enthusiast, I recognized the challenges faced by event organizers in adhering to ACP regulations while managing multiple control points across varying distances. This application was conceived as a solution to streamline this process, making it more accessible and error-free for both experienced organizers and newcomers to the sport.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the ACP Controle Time Brevets application was a significant learning experience in creating practical, domain-specific web tools. One of the main challenges was accurately implementing the ACP time calculation algorithms and ensuring they worked correctly for various race distances and scenarios. This project enhanced my skills in back-end development, particularly in handling complex calculations and data management. It also improved my understanding of creating user-friendly interfaces for specialized applications. Reflecting on the process, I'm proud to have created a tool that can make a tangible difference in the cycling community, potentially improving the organization and management of these challenging events.
