                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Anagram Web Game is a simple yet engaging webpage game where users are presented with a list of words and a jumble of letters. The objective is to form three words from the list using the provided letters. The game processes user input in real-time, providing immediate feedback after each keystroke. Correct words are displayed at the bottom of the screen, and the game concludes when three valid words are found, redirecting the user to a success page.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from a desire to create an interactive, educational game that enhances vocabulary and problem-solving skills. Anagrams have long been a popular word puzzle, and I wanted to bring this classic concept into a modern, web-based format. The real-time feedback mechanism was inspired by the need for an engaging user experience that keeps players motivated and informed throughout the gameplay.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the Anagram Web Game was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of web technologies and user interaction design. One of the main challenges was implementing the real-time word validation system, which required careful consideration of both front-end and back-end processes. This project significantly improved my skills in AJAX, Flask, JavaScript, and jQuery. It also taught me valuable lessons about creating intuitive user interfaces and managing game state in a web environment. Looking back, I'm proud of creating a game that is both fun and educational, demonstrating the potential of web technologies in interactive learning experiences.
